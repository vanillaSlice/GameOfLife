# A peculiarity of dependency caching in Gradle means that to avoid uploading the cache after every
# build you need to add the following lines to your .travis.yml:
before_cache:
- rm -f  $HOME/.gradle/caches/modules-2/modules-2.lock
- rm -fr $HOME/.gradle/caches/*/plugin-resolution/
cache:
  directories:
  - $HOME/.gradle/caches/
  - $HOME/.gradle/wrapper/
